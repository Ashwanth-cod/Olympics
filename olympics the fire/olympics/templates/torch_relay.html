            <p>
                The 2024 Summer Olympic torch relay officially commenced on April 16, 2024, beginning an extraordinary celebration of athleticism and the human spirit. 
                The tradition started with the ceremonial lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece—a symbol of peace and unity since the ancient Games. 
                As the flame flickered to life under the sunlit sky, it embodied the dreams and aspirations of athletes from around the globe, igniting hope.
            </p>
            <p>
                After its initial lighting, the torch journeyed across Greece's historic landscapes, arriving in Athens by April 26. 
                Crowds gathered to celebrate the rich heritage and cultural significance of the Olympic Games, as the flame traveled through bustling streets and ancient ruins.
            </p>

                The torch then embarked on a grand maritime voyage aboard the historic three-masted barque <i>Belem</i>. 
                On May 9, it reached the port city of Marseille, marking the start of its journey through Metropolitan France and its overseas territories, with 11,000 torchbearers sharing their stories.
